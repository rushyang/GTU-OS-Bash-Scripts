(This Repository is created to share my bash scripts with GTU students, Gujarat, India.)

Hiya Fellas! 

---Screw GTU !!--- I hope y'all know what I'm talking about!---

Alright, This Repository contains full solution of GTU OS Bash Scripts. I wrote all scripts. There is download button right top corner of the repository frame. Which will help you to download scripts altogether as an archive. You're free to download, copy, distribute, modify, understand or cram the source code! This Solutions are just for guidance and knowledge purpose. You may find source codes profound! But trust me, you don't want to be the frog in the well. 

If you have any questions / queries or ANYTHING related to UNIX / LINUX at all, DON'T ASK ME. I'm tired of giving answers of dumb questions. 

PS: I may have not changed these files' line endings to windows format. It's best to open them in linux platform directly.

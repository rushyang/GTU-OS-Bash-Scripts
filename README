(This Repository is created to share my bash scripts with GTU students, Gujarat, India.)

Hiya Fellas! 

---Screw GTU !!--- I hope y'all know what I'm talking about!--- 

Alright, This Repository contains full solution of GTU OS Bash Scripts. MCA - Sem -III Subject Code: 630007 
All scripts are solely creation of my prolific mind & internet surfing techniques. There is "Downloads" button right top corner of the repository frame. Which will help you to download scripts altogether as an archive. You're free to download, copy, distribute, modify, understand or cram the source code! These Solutions are just for guidance and knowledge purpose. You or your helper may find source codes too profound & I take no responsibility if you can't get a damn in your mind. But trust me, you don't want to be the frog in the well. 

If you have any questions / queries or ANYTHING related to UNIX / LINUX at all, DON'T ASK ME. I'm tired of giving answers of dumb questions. 

PS: I may have not changed these files' line endings to windows format. It's best to open them on the linux platform directly.

(This Repository is created to share my bash scripts with GTU students, Gujarat, India.)

Hiya Fellas! 

---Screw GTU !!--- I hope y'all know what I'm talking about!---

Alright, This Repository contains full solution of GTU OS Bash Scripts. All Scripts were Written by me. This Solutions are just for guidance and knowledge purpose. You may find many commands out of our syllabus! But trust me, you don't want to be a frog in a well. 

I hate reading Theory Ref-books originally written in 1990s. Why? Cause, then I won't get time for knowing current. Wake Up GTU!

If you have any questions / queries or ANYTHING related to UNIX / LINUX at all, you can email them to "rushyangdarji@gmail.com" or "rushyang@yahoo.co.in". There is download button right top corner of the repository frame. Which will help you to download scripts altogether in a rar file. 

PS: I may have not changed these files' line endings to windows format. It's best to open them in linux platform directly.
